Project Approach
📌 Data Preprocessing
Handles missing values and outliers
Normalizes numerical features for consistency
Splits data into training and testing sets
📌 Rank Prediction Model
Utilizes regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
Trains the model on historical performance data
Evaluates performance using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
📌 Data Visualization
Generates trend graphs for performance analysis
Provides interactive plots for insights
